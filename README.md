# KBase Genome Browser

A KBase module for rendering genome information in a web application. The goal of this module is to fetch of and about genomes and serve it in an interactive display. This data includes, but is not limited to:

* Sequence
* Gene position
* Assembled read density
* RNA expression levels
* Sequence variation and frequency
* Regulatory regions
... and so on

## More information

## Help needed
This is an incredibly early work in progress, and currently only holds some documentation. Please add to the discussion!
